It consists of App, Home, MyPage, NowPlaying Movies, and Upcoming Movies.
The home screen is the main screen, and if you press NowPlaying Movies, you can see the movie that is currently being released.
If you press Upcoming Movies, the upcoming movie will be released.
The movie data used TMDB. I replaced it because it said I had to pay a subscription fee to use IMDB.
Only NowPlaying Movies movies are available for reservation, and the movies you reserved can be found on MyPage.

Unfortunately, I implemented a reservation based on login and a movie deletion function on MyPage, but the file flew out
I've only recreated basic features. Please understand.
